### Chemistry Key Knowledge ###

#### Solubilty ####
- **Key Terms**
    - Solute: *the compound that dissolves in solution (can be a solid, liquid, or gas)*
    - Solubility: *the relative ability of a solute to dissolve into a solvent*
    - Solvent: *the compound (usually a liquid) that dissolves the solute*


- **rules**
    - *Remember; NAG SAG*
    - N `Nitrates`
    - A `Acetates`
    - G `Group 1 metals`
    - -
    - S `Sulphates`
    - A `Ammonium ions`
    - G `Group 17 non-metals`


- **relationship with temperature**
    - Generally as the temperature of a solution increases, the solubility of the molecules in the solution also increases.
    - **Why?;**
        - As the temperature of a solution increases the average kinetic velocity of all its molecules increases. The increase in kinetic energy makes it harder for intermolecular bonds to be maintained and the molecules fall apart more easily.


- **precipitation reactions**
    - A precipitation reaction occurs when two solutions containing soluble salts are combined and an insoluble salt falls out of the solution.
    - The insoluble salt that falls out of the solution is the precipitate.
    - Examples;
        - AgNO<sub>3 (aq)</sub> + KCl<sub> (aq)</sub> --> AgCl<sub> (s)</sub> + KNO<sub>3 (aq)</sub>
        - In this example you can see that the two solutes swapped one of their ions and the insoluble precipitate became solid.


#### Stoichiometry ####
- **molar concentration [*Molarity*]**
    - The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of a solute per Litre of solution.
    - Molarity = moles of solute/L of solution
    - M = n / V


- **dilution**
    - When Dilating a solution you can find out the unknown concentration / volume of the new solution with the equation: C<sub>1</sub> × V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> × V<sub>2</sub>


- **limiting & excess reactants**
    - A limiting reactant is the reactant with the fewest amount of moles.
    - It is called limiting because the limiting reactant limits the amount of the other reactant that can react. There can only be as much reaction as there is limiting reactant.


- **mass/mass stoich**

#### Acids ####
- Acid base reactions
- Net ionic equations
- Strength of acids and bases
- pH calculations

#### Redox reactions ####
- Key language; `oxidant, reductant, oxidation, reduction, oxidised, reduced`
- oxidation numbers
- half equations
- net ionic equations
- reactivity series of metals
- predicting spontaneous reactions using electrochemical series


#### Chemical Analysis ####
- UV-visible spectroscopy
- HPLC chromatography
- Atomic absorption spectroscopy
- volumetric analysis
- conductivity

**Section A: Comparative Response**
- Both texts share the idea that no matter how difficult our experiences are, there is always hope. Do you agree?
- How do both To Kill A Mockingbird and the WW1 Poems criticise social expectations?
- The characters in To Kill A Mockingbird face a moral conflict similar to the individuals in the WW1 Poems. Do you agree?
- Explore in both texts the idea that experiences teach us what is important in life.
- Compare how the WW1 Poetry and TKAM demonstrate the impact of conflict on our sense of identity.
- To Kill A Mockingbird and the WW1 Poems portray the complexities of human nature. Discuss.  

**Section B: Language Analysis**
- Your introduction should include: Context, title, date, author, form (editorial, opinion article etc), publication (The Age etc.), contention and tone.
- Remember to be specific regarding the impact on the reader. How does the language position the audience to respond?
- Read carefully, annotate and write a response for the following text:
